        <h1>I asked</h1>
        <p>Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says: </p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="name" align="left">Pocky: </span>
            <p class="message" align="center"> Cool and all but who asked ? </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This doesn't make sense and makes you look dumb <br>
            Also this is a old , dead meme and you should feel bad about yourself <br><br>
            Rather you should support the person and say "I asked" <br>
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <span class="name" align="left">Nathan: </span>
            <p class="message2" align="center"> I asked ! </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            By saying "I asked" you get to play the good guy <br>
            You get to be the one who gets the credit for the question <br><br>

            So next time you see someone saying who asked ? <br>
            Just post the link to this website <br>
